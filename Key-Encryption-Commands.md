![Key Encryption Commands](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/master/img/key-encryption-commands.png)

### Notice
* Key Encryption functionality is new in **version3**.
* Commands may seem slow to complete, this is a [feature](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0038.mediawiki#discussion-item-scrypt-parameters).
* Commands are not affected by the `--with-testnet` build configuration.
* See also information pertaining to [Altchain Encrypted Private Keys](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/wiki/Altchain-Encrypted-Private-Keys).
* See [Altcoin Version Mappings](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/wiki/Altcoin-Version-Mappings) for table of encoded key and address mappings.
* The commands [ek-public](bx-ek-public), [ek-public-to-address](bx-ek-public-to-address) and [ek-public-to-ec](bx-ek-public-to-ec) are **deprecated** for reasons described in [BIP38-Security-Considerations](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/wiki/BIP38-Security-Considerations).
